# Backend Training Projects - Soft ITO

This repository contains the daily projects I will be working on during my Backend Training at Soft ITO. The focus of the training is to learn C# and backend development concepts. I will upload my progress and completed projects here every day.

## Training Overview

The backend training will cover the following key topics:

- **C# Programming**
- **Backend Development Fundamentals**
- **Database Management**
- **APIs and Web Services**
- **Security in Backend Development**
- **DevOps and Deployment**

## Projects

Each project will focus on specific backend topics, starting from the basics of C# and advancing to complex backend applications.

### Daily Progress
- **Day 1**: What is the Algorithms, Basic C# syntax and Variables Rules
- **Day 2**: Operators, conditional statements, simple calculator, and exam score simulation.
- **Day 3**: Explored body mass index calculation, fuel price comparison, switch case, ternary operator, loops (for, do, while), and pattern creation.
- **Day 4**: Loops, Patterns, and  Basic Banking System
- **Day 5**: Arrays and Methods
- **Day 6**: Methods and SQL Queries
- **Day 7**: SQL Queries and Basic Database Operations
- **Day 8**: Advanced SQL Queries and Relationships
- **Day 9**: SQL Insert, Update, Delete, and Views

### Homework Progress
- **Homework 1**: In this task, all `for` loops were converted into `while` loops.
- **Homework 2**: A simple cafe management system was designed where tables were selected, orders were placed from the menu, the bill was calculated, and payment was processed, all using if, for, switch-case, and arrays.
